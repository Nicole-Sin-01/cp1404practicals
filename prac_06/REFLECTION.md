# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks before coding. Using functions to separate logic has helped make my code more readable and reusable. Additionally, I have been testing my code incrementally instead of writing everything at once, which has reduced debugging time.


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management, especially when working on assignments. Sometimes, I spend too much time perfecting small details instead of focusing on the bigger picture. I also need to be more consistent in reviewing the lecture materials before starting practicals, so I don't waste time trying to recall concepts.



## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been actively practicing coding outside of class via study groups, which has improved my understanding of the concepts since I need to teach others too. I also make use of the sample code provided and modify it to see how small changes affect the program. I also find asking questions and referring to the documentation when needed helpful.



## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop second-guessing my code too much and trust my problem-solving process. Instead of constantly rewriting sections before testing them, I should focus on writing clear, structured code first and then refining it after testing. I also want to improve my ability to read and understand error messages more efficiently instead of just trial and error. I hope to be able to remember the structure of certain topics like Classes so that I can reflect them properly during exams.



## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

That the examination component is removed, as real-world coding heavily relies on trial and error, referencing past work, and using pre-existing code. While understanding how to apply concepts is important, the exam feels more like a test of memorizationâ€”especially since it's hand-written and doesn't allow for testing in Python. Instead, it would be more beneficial to have real-world coding exercises, mini-projects that simulate software development, and more guided explanations on best coding practices beyond just syntax.
